# 🍅 Focus Timer | Pomodoro ⏱️

A simple and effective web-based Pomodoro timer to help you stay focused and productive.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
*   Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional, for customization)
*   Node.js and npm (if you plan to use the development server)

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rohan2by1/web_pomodoro.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd web_pomodoro
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **To run the development server (with live reloading):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will typically start a local server (e.g., using `webpack-dev-server` or similar) and open the application in your browser.  Check the console output for the exact address.

5.  **Alternatively, to simply open the timer:**

    Open `index.html` in your web browser.
